### Hey! I'm Joe 👋

- You can find me working on documentation at GitHub 🐙🐈‍⬛
- I love my cats, Tony and Juniper. They are best friends and so cute I can barely handle it. 
- Ask me about growing vegetables, pollinators and flowers, [film photography/developing](https://jorclork.com/photos/), having too many hobbies, ridiculously long books, and weird chord progressions. 
- I'm probably listening to Radiohead, let's be honest.
