### Hey! I'm Joe 👋

- You can find me working on GitHub [docs](https://docs.github.com/).
- I love my cats, Tony and Juniper. They are best friends and so cute I can barely handle it. 
- Ask me about growing vegetables, film photography/developing, strange time signatures, having too many hobbies, and ridiculously long books. 
- I'm probably listening to Radiohead.
