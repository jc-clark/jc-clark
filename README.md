You can find me working on GitHub [docs](https://docs.github.com/).
I love my cats, Tony and Juniper. They are best friends and so cute I can barely handle it.
Ask me about growing vegetables, film photography/developing, strange time signatures, having too many hobbies, and ridiculously long books.
I'm probably listening to Radiohead.
