### Hey! I'm Joe ðŸ‘‹

- You can find me working on GitHub [docs](https://docs.github.com/).
- I love my cats, Tony and Juniper. They are best friends and so cute I can barely handle it. 
- Ask me about growing vegetables, pollinators and flowers, film photography/developing, having too many hobbies, ridiculously long books, and weird chord progressions. 
- I'm probably listening to Radiohead, let's be honest.
